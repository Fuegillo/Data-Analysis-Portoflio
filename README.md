## About

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Marcos!

I'm an aspiring Data Analyst with a strong passion for transforming data into actionable insights. I have hands-on experience with SQL, Python, Excel, and data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau. My work focuses on uncovering patterns and trends that drive decision-making and business growth.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
