# Marcos Garcia - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Marcos!

I'm an aspiring Data Analyst passionate about transforming data into actionable insights. I have hands-on experience with SQL, Python, Excel, and data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau. My work involves uncovering patterns and trends that drive decision-making and business growth.

I am currently studying Data Science & Analytics at Instituto TecnolÃ³gico de Las AmÃ©ricas (ITLA)

I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques in my free time, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

Here is my [CV](https://github.com/Fuegillo/Data-Analysis-Portoflio/blob/main/Marcos_Garcia_CV.pdf).

This is a repository to showcase skills and share projects.
